# Advanced-Hydrophonic-Plant-Growth-Chamber
## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project presents an intelligent, automated hydroponic system designed for sustainable urban agriculture. Leveraging ESP32, a suite of sensors, and an IoT-enabled interface, the system autonomously maintains optimal growing conditions for plants minimizing manual intervention while maximizing yield and resource efficiency.
The project targets key global challenges such as water scarcity, climate unpredictability, and limited arable land, offering a smart, scalable, and sustainable solution for modern agriculture.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Automate control of pH, nutrient concentration, light, humidity, and temperature
- Monitor real-time environmental parameters with sensor feedback
- Provide user interaction via web dashboard hosted on ESP32
- Enable cloud integration and remote access
- Achieve water-efficient and soil-free farming using hydroponic principles
